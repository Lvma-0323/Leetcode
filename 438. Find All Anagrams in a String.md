# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String
### Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

### An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4
s and p consist of lowercase English letters.
```

#### My code
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
        vector<int> ans;
        if(s.size() < p.size()) return ans;
        vector<int> map (26, 0);
        vector<int> window (26, 0);

        for(int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++){
            map[p[i] - 'a']++;
            window[s[i] - 'a']++;
        }
        if(window == map) ans.push_back(0);

        for(int i = 1; i < s.size()-p.size()+1; i++)
        {
            window[s[i+p.size()-1] - 'a']++; //right+1
            window[s[i-1] - 'a']--; //left-1
            if(window == map) ans.push_back(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
