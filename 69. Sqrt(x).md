# 69. Sqrt(x)
### Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.
### Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.
### Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**
```
0 <= x <= 231 - 1
```
